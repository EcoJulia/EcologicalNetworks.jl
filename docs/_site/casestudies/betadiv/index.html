    <h1>Network β-diversity</h1>
    <p>In this case study, we will compare the species composition and interaction
composition of a collection of networks:</p>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Tr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">map</span><span class="x">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">convert</span><span class="x">(</span><span class="n">BinaryNetwork</span><span class="x">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="x">),</span> <span class="n">trojelsgaard_et_al_2014</span><span class="x">())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="is-there-strong-global-β-diversity">Is there strong global β-diversity?</h2>

<p>For this first question, we will compare each network to its relevant part in
the metaweb – this offers a way to measure how different each <em>measured</em>
network is compared to what we would expect knowing all regional interactions.</p>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">metaweb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">reduce</span><span class="x">(</span><span class="n">union</span><span class="x">,</span> <span class="n">Tr</span><span class="x">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function to measure the difference between interactions between shared
species is <code class="highlighter-rouge">βos</code>: we can apply it to an array of network using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> syntax.</p>

<p>We can pipe the output all the way to a plot:</p>
