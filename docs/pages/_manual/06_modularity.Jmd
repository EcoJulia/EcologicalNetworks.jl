```julia; echo=false
using EcologicalNetwork
```

There are two steps to modularity analysis. First, we assign a module *a priori*
to all species in the network. Second, we optimize this partition using
heuristics. We will illustrate how these functions work by simulating a reasonably modular network:

```julia
A = zeros(Bool, (12,12))
A[1:6,1:6] = rand(Float64, (6,6)).<0.8
A[7:12,7:12] = rand(Float64, (6,6)).<0.8
B = simplify(BipartiteNetwork(A))
```

## Initial modules assignation

Modules are stored as a dictionary with one integer value for each species in
the network. The functions to perform the initial modules assignation must
return a tuple with the network in the first position, and the dictionary of
modules in the second position.

### Random modules

One current way to proceed is to guesstimate the number of modules, and assign
species to them at random. This can be done with the `n_random_modules`
function:

```julia
five_rand = n_random_modules(5)
five_rand(B)[2]
```

Note that `n_random_modules` *returns* a function which will create `n` modules
at random.

### One module for every species

```julia
each_species_its_module(B)[2]
```

### Label propagation

`EcologicalNetwork` offers a `lp` function for label propagation @TODO -- while
most adapted for large graphs, we found that LP usually gives a robust starting
partition regardless of the size.

```julia
initial_p = lp(B)
initial_p[2]
```

## Modularity optimization

Functions to optimize the modularity accept two arguments: a network, and a
dictionary with modules identity. You may recognize this as the output of the
functions to initially assign modules, and you would be right. This allows
unpacking the output of the initial module assignation function into the
modularity function, following the template of

```
modularity(initial(network)...)
```

### BRIM

```julia
initial_p = lp(B)
b_brim = brim(initial_p...)
b_brim[2]
```
