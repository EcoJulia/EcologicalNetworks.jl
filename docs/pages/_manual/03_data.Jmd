```julia; echo=false
using EcologicalNetwork
```

`EcologicalNetwork` currently comes with two datasets. The first is the
`http://www.web-of-life.es/` database of bipartite networks, accessible through
`web_of_life()`. The second is a collection of food webs from New-Zealand
streams, accessible through `nz_stream_foodweb()`.

## Web of life

Calling the `web_of_life()` function *without* arguments will return an array of
`NamedTuple`, which can be used to select the networks we want.

```julia
all_of_wol = web_of_life()
eurasia_rodents = filter(x -> contains(x[:Reference], "Hadfield"), all_of_wol)
rodents_id = getfield.(eurasia_rodents, :ID)
rodents_id[1:3]
```

Any of these identifiers can be passed to the `web_of_life()` function, which
will return the network:

```julia
web_of_life(first(rodents_id))
```

Note that many networks in this dataset have issues on the original website. We
corrected as many as we found, based on a complete download from Apr 28, 2018.
We will replace this dataset with a more carefully curated source in the near
future.

## New Zealand streams

The `nz_stream_foodweb()` returns an array of unipartite networks. Some foodwebs
from the original dataset have been removed due to formatting issues. Again,
they will be replaced by a curated set of data in the future.
