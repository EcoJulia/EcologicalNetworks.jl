`EcologicalNetwork` offers functions to count motifs in multiple sorts of
networks. The most important function to know about is `find_motif`, which
requires two arguments: a network, and a motif.



**TODO** explain how it works



## Generalities



The `find_motif` function will return an array with species that form the
given motifs. Depending on the size of the network, and the frequency of the
motif, this array can get quite big.

````julia
N = fonseca_ganade_1996()
m = BipartiteNetwork([true true false; false true true])
motif = find_motif(N,m)
println("This motif is found $(length(motif)) times")
````


````
This motif is found 50 times
````






````
This motif is found 50 times
````




Because the identity of species is returned, we can extract a sub-network to
check that it is indeed in the correct conformation. Note that we use `...`
to *unpack* the species name in order to access the correct sub-network.

````julia
N[first(motif)...].A
````


````
2×3 Array{Int64,2}:
 3  27  0
 0   2  2
````






````
2×3 Array{Int64,2}:
 3  27  0
 0   2  2
````




You may also notice that the network is quantitative, but the motif is not.
By default, the function *requires* motifs to be of the `BinaryNetwork` type
(and their partiteness must match the one of the network). The network in
which you want to count motifs can be either binary (no operation applied),
probabilistic (no operation applied), or quantitative (converted to binary).
Unipartite networks have their diagonal removed.



## Probabilistic networks



The `find_motif` function also works for probabilistic networks -- the only
difference is that it will return *all* species combinations, with an
associated probability of the combination forming the motif, and a variance.
The output of this function will therefore be an array with elements of the
shape `((species,),(mean,variance))`.

````julia
U = thompson_townsend_catlins()
m = unipartitemotifs()[:S1]
N = null2(U)
motif = find_motif(N, m)
first(motif)
````


````
((String["Unidentified detritus", "Plant material", "Terrestrial invertebra
tes"],), (0.07724994680572411, 0.07486477493756385))
````

tes"],), (0.07724994680572411, 0.07486477493756385))
````




Because *all* species combinations are returned, this object *will* get big.
There is no anticipated workaround at this time.



There is a convenience function to measure the expected count of any motif
measured on a probabilistic network, and its variance:
`expected_motif_count`.

````julia
expected_motif_count(motif)
