The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how we can use the package to
perform significance testing. We will see how we can compare the measured
value of nestedness to random values derived from network permutations.



We start by loading a network, in this case the one by Fonseca & Ganade
(1996). This is a bipartite network.

````julia
using EcologicalNetwork
N = fonseca_ganade_1996()
````




We will start by getting rid of the quantitative information. This is done by
converting our network to another type:

````julia
M = convert(BipartiteNetwork, N)
````





We will now measure the nestedness of the network, using the $\eta$ measure:

````julia
n0 = η(M);
````




This returns a dictionary with a value for the rows, the columns, and the
entire network.

````julia
n0
````


````
Dict{Symbol,Float64} with 3 entries:
  :rows    => 0.187648
  :network => 0.168149
  :columns => 0.148649
````




At this point, we will need to generate a few random matrices to test our
empirical measure against. We will focus on the Type II null model, in which
the probability of an interaction between two species is proportional to
their relative degrees. We will call this probabilistic template `T`:

````julia
T = null2(M)
````





This function will return another network, this time a probabilistic one.

````julia
typeof(T)
````


````
EcologicalNetwork.BipartiteProbabilisticNetwork{Float64,String}
````





We can draw a random sample based on this template:

````julia
rand(T)
````


````
EcologicalNetwork.BipartiteNetwork{String}(Bool[false false … false false
; false false … false false; … ; false false … false false; false fal
se … false false], String["Camponotus balzanii", "Azteca alfari", "Azteca
 isthmica", "Azteca aff. Isthmica", "Allomerus D", "Allomerus prancei", "Al
lomerus aff. Octoarticulata", "Solenops A", "Allomerus auripunctata", "Crem
atogaster B"  …  "Crematogaster A", "Azteca TO", "Crematogaster C", "Azte
ca schummani", "Pseudomyrmex nigrescens", "Pseudomyrmex concolor", "Azteca 
D", "Azteca polymorpha", "Crematogaster E", "Azteca Q"], String["Cecropia p
urpuracens", "Cecropia concolor", "Cecropia distachya", "Cecropia ficifolia
", "Pouruma heterophylla", "Hirtella myrmecophila", "Hirtella physophora", 
"Duroia saccifera", "Cordia nodosa", "Cordia aff. Nodosa", "Tococa bullifer
a", "Maieta guianensis", "Maieta poeppiggi", "Tachigali polyphylla", "Tachi
gali myrmecophila", "Amaioua aff. Guianensis"])
````





Of course, we would like to generate a larger sample -- so we can draw many
replicates at once:

````julia
random_draws = rand(T, 10000)
````




Some of these networks may be *degenerate*, *i.e.* they have species without
interactions. It is safer to remove them from our sample:

````julia
valid_draws = filter(x -> !isdegenerate(x), random_draws)
````




We are left with a smaller number of networks, but all of them have species
with at least one interaction. At this point, we can measure the nestedness
on all of these networks:

````julia
n_prime = map(x -> η(x)[:network], valid_draws)
````




We can now figure out the quantile of the original network in the random
distribution -- in permutation testing, if this is lower than 0.05 or higher
than 0.95, the network is significantly different than expected by chance
under the specified null model:

````julia
quantile(n_prime, n0[:network])
````



0.1888425704492268


We can also express much of this analysis as a single pipeline:

````julia
n_prime = N |>
    # Step 1 - remove interaction strength
    n -> convert(BipartiteNetwork, n) |>
    # Step 2 - generate the probability template
    null2 |>
    # Step 3 - draw random networks
    n -> rand(n, 10000) |>
    # Step 4 - remove degenerate networks
    n -> filter(x -> !isdegenerate(x), n) .|>
    # Step 5 - measure the nestedness
    n -> η(n)[:network]
````




This notation is more compact, and can help understand the flow of the
analysis better.



Finally, we can also look at the distribution of these values:

````julia
histogram(n_prime)
````


<pre class="julia-error">
ERROR: UndefVarError: histogram not defined
</pre>


````julia
vline!([n0[:network]])
````


<pre class="julia-error">
ERROR: UndefVarError: vline&#33; not defined
</pre>
