This `julia` package provides a common interface to analyze all types of data on
ecological networks. It is designed to be general, easy to expand, and work on
bipartite/unipartite as well as deterministic/quantitative/probabilistic
networks. It is compatible with Julia v0.6.

This package is *very* opinionated about the right way to analyze ecological
networks - fortunately, we have documented (and justified) these opinions in an
extensive review by @DelBes17. We recommend reading this manuscript, as it
lists the measures implemented here, details their interpretation, and justifies
some best practices.

Almost all of the measures for probabilistic networks can be found in the
original paper by @PoiCir16. Some measures are in the package only, as they have
been derived after we published the original paper.

The functions in this package are robustly tested (and we also run entire case
studies as part of our testing strategy to make sure it all fits snugly
together). We do not guarantee that there are no bugs or edge-cases in the code,
but our aim is to provide a robust, user-friendly, and general platform to
analyze ecological networks following the very best standards possible.

## How to read this documentation

It is advised you start reading some of the "Case studies": they will give you a
feel about the syntax of the package, and showcase some of the nice syntax you
can use. The "Manual" pages give a more in-depth presentation of specific
applications and families of measures. Throughout the documentation, we have
linked the relevant papers, and discuss what we believe are the best practices.
We do not suggest you read this documentation as an analysis to the introduction
of ecological network, but be prepared to find some discussion of the measures
(and not only of the code).

Every page of this documentation is automatically generated. This ensures that
you can copy the code blocks with `INPUT` at the top, and get the same result
(with the exception of results that involved some stochasticity).

## Getting started

Install the package with
