# Measuring the modularity

In this example, we will use [`label_propagation`](@ref) to optimize the
modularity of a network. The data are from the [`mcmullen`](@ref) dataset.

~~~@example
using EcologicalNetwork

# Get the data in an object
N = mcmullen();

# We will start with a random assignment of species within modules
L = rand(1:richness(N), richness(N));

# We can now start a repeated number of attempts to find the best partition. If
# julia is started in parallel, this will use all assigned CPUs.
M = modularity(N, L, replicates=100);

# We can look at the distribution of the Q, using the `UnicodePlots` package
Pkg.add("UnicodePlots")
using UnicodePlots

# Note the "dot" notation here: we apply Q to every elements of M
histogram(Q.(M), symb="-")

# Finally, we can get the best partition
b_part = best_partition(M);

# And print its modularity and number of modules
println("Q: ",
        round(b_part[1].Q, 2),
        " |c|: ",
        length(unique(b_part[1].L))
        )
