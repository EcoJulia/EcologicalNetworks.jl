# Integration with Mangal.jl

In this example, we will show how `EcologicalNetworks.jl` can be integrated with [`Mangal.jl`](https://github.com/EcoJulia/Mangal.jl) to analyse many ecological networks. Specifically, we will show how to analyse the association between meaningful network properties (i.e. species richness, connectance, nestedness, and modularity) using all food webs archived on the [`mangal.io`](https://mangal.io/#/) online database.

To conduct this analysis, we need to upload the following packages:

```@example mangal
using EcologicalNetworks
using Mangal
using DataFrames
using Plots
```

We first retrieve relevant metadata for all networks archived on `mangal.io` using the `Mangal.jl` package. We count the number of species $S$ and the total number of interactions $L$ in each network, as well as their number of trophic interactions (predation and herbivory). We store these information in a data frame along with the networks' ID numbers.

```@example mangal
number_of_networks = count(MangalNetwork)
count_per_page = 100
number_of_pages = convert(Int, ceil(number_of_networks/count_per_page))

mangal_networks = DataFrame(fill(Int64, 5),
                 [:id, :S, :L, :pred, :herb],
                 number_of_networks)

global cursor = 1
@progress "Paging networks" for page in 1:number_of_pages
    global cursor
    networks_in_page = Mangal.networks("count" => count_per_page, "page" => page-1)
    @progress "Counting items" for current_network in networks_in_page
        S = count(MangalNode, current_network)
        L = count(MangalInteraction, current_network)
        pred = count(MangalInteraction, current_network, "type" => "predation")
        herb = count(MangalInteraction, current_network, "type" => "herbivory")
        mangal_networks[cursor,:] .= (current_network.id, S, L, pred, herb)
        cursor = cursor + 1
    end
end
```

We now have all the information we need to identify all food webs archived on `mangal.io`. Here we consider as food webs any ecological networks mainly composed of trophic interactions.

```@example mangal
mangal_foodwebs = mangal_networks[mangal_networks[!, :pred] .+ mangal_networks[!, :herb] ./ mangal_networks[!, :L] .> 0.5, :]
```

To analyse their properties, we first need to read all of these food webs using the `Mangal.jl` package, and then convert them to UnipartiteNetworks, when possible, using the `EcologicalNetworks.jl` package.

```@example mangal
mangal_foodwebs = network.(foodwebs.id)

unipartite_foodwebs = []

for i in eachindex(mangal_foodwebs)
    try
        unipartite_foodweb = convert(UnipartiteNetwork, mangal_foodwebs[i])
        push!(unipartite_foodwebs, unipartite_foodweb)
    catch
        println("Cannot convert mangal food web $(i) to a unipartite network")
    end
end
```

We can then compute any measure supported by `EcologicalNetworks.jl` for UnipartiteNetworks. In this example, we compute species richness, connectance, nestedness, and modularity. To compute network modularity, we use 100 random species assignments in 3 to 15 groups as our starters, the BRIM algorithm to optimize the modularity for each of these random partitions, and retain the maximum value for each food web.

```@example mangal
foodweb_measures = DataFrame(fill(Float64, 4),
                 [:rich, :connect, :nested, :modul],
                 length(unipartite_foodwebs))

# species richness
foodweb_measures.rich = richness.(unipartite_foodwebs)

# connectance
foodweb_measures.connect = connectance.(unipartite_foodwebs)

# nestedness
foodweb_measures.nested = ρ.(unipartite_foodwebs)

# modularity (BRIM algorithm)
number_of_modules = repeat(3:15, outer=100)
modules = Array{Dict}(undef, length(number_of_modules))

for i in eachindex(unipartite_foodwebs)
    current_network = unipartite_foodwebs[i]
    for j in eachindex(number_of_modules)
        _, modules[j] = n_random_modules(number_of_modules[j])(current_network) |> x -> brim(x...)
    end
    partition_modularity = map(x -> Q(current_network,x), modules);
    foodweb_measures.modul[i] = maximum(partition_modularity)
end
```

The association between these food-web measures can then be plotted. In each subplot, marker size is proportional to species richness.

```@example mangal
# color palette
pal=RGB(204/255,121/255,167/255)

plotA = scatter(foodweb_measures.connect, foodweb_measures.nested,
    markersize=foodweb_measures.rich ./ 30,
    alpha=0.6, color=pal,
    lab="",
    dpi=1000, framestyle=:box)
xaxis!("Connectance")
yaxis!((0.4,0.9), "Nestedness")

plotB = scatter(foodweb_measures.connect, foodweb_measures.modul,
    markersize=foodweb_measures.rich ./ 30,
    alpha=0.6, color=pal,
    lab="",
    dpi=1000, framestyle=:box)
xaxis!("Connectance")
yaxis!("Modularity")

plotC = scatter(foodweb_measures.modul, foodweb_measures.nested,
    markersize=foodweb_measures.rich ./ 30,
    alpha=0.6, color=pal,
    lab="",
    dpi=1000, framestyle=:box)
xaxis!("Modularity")
yaxis!((0.4,0.9), "Nestedness")

plot(plotA, plotB, plotC, layout=(1,3),
    title=["($i)" for j in 1:1, i in 1:3], titleloc=:right, titlefont = font(12),
    size=(700,350), margin=5Plots.mm)
```
