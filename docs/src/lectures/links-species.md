# How many things are in a network?

## Reading before class

## How many species and how many interactions

## Are richer networks more connected?

## Fitting the L-S relationship(s)

## What do we learn about ecological systems?

## But why do we care?

- role of connectance
- literature on complexity/stability

## Suggested activities for next week

- is there a min/max number of interactions for a given richness?
