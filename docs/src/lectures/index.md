# The analysis of species interactions networks

These pages act as the syllabus for classes BIO6037 and BIO3043 at the
Université de Montréal. The classes uses `EcologicalNetworks.jl` for all
computer labs. In addition to serving as a syllabus and lecture notes,
the goal of these pages is to expand on the documentation by providing
a broad perspective, steeped in practice, on how to analyse networks of
species interactions.
