# Informations about types

As there are many ways to represent ecological networks, and the correct
way to measure a given property varies in function of the representation,
`EcologicalNetwork` has a series of built-in types.

## Type hierarchy

The `EcologicalNetwork` package has six main types that are meant
to be used by the user: `BipartiteNetwork`, `BipartiteProbaNetwork`,
`BipartiteQuantiNetwork`, `UnipartiteNetwork`, `UnipartiteProbaNetwork`
and `UnipartiteQuantiNetwork`. All types with `Proba` in their names are
meant to represent probabilistic networks, and are also part of the union
type `ProbabilisticNetwork`. All types *without* `Proba` in their name are
part of the union type `DeterministicNetwork`, and represent networks in
which interactions are either present or absent. All types with `Quanti`
in their names are part of the `QuantitativeNetwork` groups, and represent
networks with weighted interactions. All types starting with `Bipartite`
are also part of the abstract type `Bipartite`, and types with `Unipartite`
in their names are part of the abstract type `Unipartite`. Finally, both
`Unipartite` and `Bipartite` are part of the abstract type `EcoNetwork`.

Although this may seem convoluted, this is important to understand: when
writing functions, you can restrict them to any type of network you want by
using the right type in their declaration. You can also check properties of
a network just by looking at its type. For example, one can check whether
a network `N` is bipartite with:

```julia
typeof(N) <: Bipartite
```

Networks are represented as two-dimensional matrices. All types are simply
wrappers around an adjacency matrix, stored as the `A` property of the
object. To look at the adjacency matrix of a network `N`, one therefore
uses `N.A`. These matrices must be read as: the existence/probability of
an interaction *from* the species of the *i*-th row *to* the species in the
*j*-th column. This implies that the networks are, by default, directed.

Note that the type of a network will determine what methods can be applied
to it. For example, all measures of variance are only making sense for
probabilistic networks.

## Data types

Interactions in deterministic networks are represented as boolean
(`true`/`false`) values. This is memory efficient, so large networks can be
represented (one interactions represented as a boolean uses 8 times fewer
memory than the same interaction represented as an integer). This being said,
all networks of the `DeterministicNetwork` type can be read from matrices
of integers, *as long as these matrices only contain 0 and 1*.

In probabilistic networks, interactions are stored as floating point
(`Float64`) numbers. These values have to be between 0.0 and 1.0, as they
represent probabilities. In quantitative networks, interactions are stored
as any type of number.

Networks of the `Unipartite` class must have the same number of rows and
columns. The species in the rows and columns are the same. Networks of the
`Bipartite` class are expected to have different numbers of rows and columns,
as the species in rows and columns are different species. It is possible to
convert a network from `Bipartite` to `Unipartite` using the `make_unipartite`
function:

~~~@example
using EcologicalNetwork
B = BipartiteNetwork(rand(Bool, (3, 5)))
U = make_unipartite(B)
richness(U) == richness(B)
~~~

The documentation for `make_unipartite` gives additional explanations about
how the conversion is done. In the overwhelming majority of cases, applying
any measure to a bipartite network, and to the same network made unipartite,
should give the same results (connectance is one notable example).
