# Specificity

All measures of specificity are setup so that maximal specificity is 1, and
maximal generality is 0. By default, specificity of quantitative networks is
measured using the *PDI* index, and the specificity of deterministic networks is
measured using the *RR* index. These two are mathematically equivalent when
applied to a deterministic network.
