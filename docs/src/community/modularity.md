# Modularity

There are a number of modularity-related functions in `EcologicalNetworks`. The
optimal modularity structure is detected by optimizing $Q$, which returns
values increasingly close to unity when the modular structure is strong. The
$Q'_R$ measure is also included for *a posteriori* evaluation of the
modularity.
