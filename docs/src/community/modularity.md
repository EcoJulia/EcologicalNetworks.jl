# Modularity

There are a number of modularity-related functions in `EcologicalNetworks`. The
optimal modularity structure is detected by optimizing $Q$, which returns values
increasingly close to unity when the modular structure is strong. The $Q_r$
measure is also included for *a posteriori* evaluation of the modularity.

## Types

The object returned by all modularity detection functions has the type
`Partition`.

In addition, there is a measure of *realized* modularity:

## Functions for modularity detection

The first function included is `label_propagation`, which is working well for
large graphs. It can also be useful to generate an initial modular partition.

For larger graphs (as long as they are not probabilistic), there is the
`louvain` function. It is *not* the most aggressively optimized implementation.
