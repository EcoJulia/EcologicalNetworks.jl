#' The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how we can use the package to
#' perform significance testing. We will see how we can compare the measured
#' value of nestedness to random values derived from network permutations.

#' We start by loading a network, in this case the one by Fonseca & Ganade
#' (1996). This is a bipartite network.

N = fonseca_ganade_1996()

#' We will start by getting rid of the quantitative information. This is done by
#' converting our network to another type:

M = convert(BipartiteNetwork, N)

#+ echo=false;results="hidden"
@test typeof(M) <: BinaryNetwork

#' We will now measure the nestedness of the network, using the $\eta$ measure:

n0 = η(M);

#' This returns a dictionary with a value for the rows, the columns, and the
#' entire network.

n0

#' At this point, we will need to generate a few random matrices to test our
#' empirical measure against. We will focus on the Type II null model, in which
#' the probability of an interaction between two species is proportional to
#' their relative degrees. We will call this probabilistic template `T`:

T = null2(M)

#+ echo=false; results="hidden"
@test richness(T) == richness(M)

#' This function will return another network, this time a probabilistic one.

typeof(T)

#+ echo=false;results="hidden"
@test typeof(T) <: ProbabilisticNetwork

#' We can draw a random sample based on this template:

rand(T)

#+ echo=false;results="hidden"
@test typeof(rand(T)) == typeof(M)
@test species(rand(T)) == species(T)

#' Of course, we would like to generate a larger sample -- so we can draw many
#' replicates at once:

random_draws = rand(T, 10000)

#' Some of these networks may be *degenerate*, *i.e.* they have species without
#' interactions. It is safer to remove them from our sample:

valid_draws = filter(x -> !isdegenerate(x), random_draws)

#' We are left with a smaller number of networks, but all of them have species
#' with at least one interaction. At this point, we can measure the nestedness
#' on all of these networks:

n_prime = map(x -> η(x)[:network], valid_draws)

#' We can now figure out the quantile of the original network in the random
#' distribution -- in permutation testing, if this is lower than 0.05 or higher
#' than 0.95, the network is significantly different than expected by chance
#' under the specified null model:

quantile(n_prime, n0[:network])

#' We can also express much of this analysis as a single pipeline:

n_prime = N |>
    # Step 1 - remove interaction strength
    n -> convert(BipartiteNetwork, n) |>
    # Step 2 - generate the probability template
    null2 |>
    # Step 3 - draw random networks
    n -> rand(n, 10000) |>
    # Step 4 - remove degenerate networks
    n -> filter(x -> !isdegenerate(x), n) .|>
    # Step 5 - measure the nestedness
    n -> η(n)[:network]

#' This notation is more compact, and can help understand the flow of the
#' analysis better.

#' Finally, we can also look at the distribution of these values:

histogram(n_prime)
vline!([n0[:network]])
