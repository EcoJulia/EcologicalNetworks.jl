#' `EcologicalNetwork` uses a series of types to represent networks. Before we
#' dig in, it is important to get a sense of what the types can do for you. The
#' type of a network is used to define the types of things you can do to it. For
#' example, the correct way to measure nestedness changes depending on if the
#' network is quantitative or binary. Picking the correct network is important.

#' ## Network types

#' There are three types of networks 

using EcologicalNetwork
using Base.Test

N = fonseca_ganade_1996()

#' The type of networks have a hierarchy between them. We can test that this
#' network is bipartite:
@test typeof(N) <: AbstractBipartiteNetwork

#' We can also check that it is quantitative:
@test typeof(N) <: QuantitativeNetwork

#' Finally, we can also check that it is not probabilistic:
@test typeof(N) <: DeterministicNetwork
