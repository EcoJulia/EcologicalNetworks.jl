#' `EcologicalNetwork` uses a series of types to represent networks. Before we
#' dig in, it is important to get a sense of what the types can do for you. The
#' type of a network is used to define the types of things you can do to it. For
#' example, the correct way to measure nestedness changes depending on if the
#' network is quantitative or binary. Picking the correct network is important,
#' and this page will walk you through the different types available.

#' ## Network types

#' There are three types of networks: binary (where interactions are either
#' present or absent), quantitative (interactions have a strength), and
#' probabilistic (interactions have a probability of happening). All of these
#' networks share the same underlying structure: a matrix that can store
#' elements of different types, and species names. This matrix is stored in the
#' field `A` of the network object.

#' Species names are stored differently depending on whether the network is
#' bipartite or unipartite. In unipartite networks (*e.g.* food webs), there is
#' a single field `S` for species. In bipartite networks, there are two fields
#' `T` and `B`, for the top and bottom level of the network. The names of
#' species are either `AbstractString` or `Symbol` values (and they cannot be
#' mixed with a single network).

#' The interactions go from the rows, to the columns, of the matrix in `A`. In
#' practice, there is no need to call the fields directly: we can access the
#' species names using the `species` functions.

#' Types are named using the `{Partiteness}{Type}Network`, where `{Partiteness}`
#' is either `Unipartite` or `Bipartite`, and  `{Type}` is either
#' `Probabilistic` or `Quantitative` -- the `Binary` type, being considered the
#' default, is omitted. The six basic types available are therefore
#' `BipartiteNetwork`, `UnipartiteNetwork`, `BipartiteQuantitativeNetwork`,
#' `UnipartiteQuantitativeNetwork`, `BipartiteProbabilisticNetwork`, and
#' `UnipartiteProbabilisticNetwork`.

#' ## Network conversions

#' Network objects can be converted into objects of another type. For example,
#' the information about interaction strength can be removed by converting a
#' `BipartiteQuantitativeNetwork` into a `BipartiteNetwork`. Let us start by
#' loading a network:

N = fonseca_ganade_1996();
typeof(N)

#' The conversion itself is performed with:

M = convert(BipartiteNetwork, N);
typeof(M)

#' The conversion system also uses abstract types to make your life easier: we
#' can convert to an abstract type, which makes the code more general. To change
#' the partiteness of a network, we can use the `AbstractUnipartiteNetwork`
#' conversion.

#+ echo=false; results="hidden"
@test typeof(convert(AbstractUnipartiteNetwork, N)) <: UnipartiteQuantitativeNetwork
@test typeof(convert(BinaryNetwork, N)) <: BipartiteNetwork

#+ term=true
typeof(convert(AbstractUnipartiteNetwork, N))
typeof(convert(BinaryNetwork, N))

#' These transformations can be chained together: to project the network into a
#' unipartite shape *and* remove quantitative information, we can use the
#' following:

#+ term=true
M = N |>
    x -> convert(AbstractUnipartiteNetwork, x) |>
    x -> convert(BinaryNetwork, x);
typeof(M)

#+ echo=false; results="hidden"
@test typeof(N) <: AbstractBipartiteNetwork
@test typeof(N) <: QuantitativeNetwork
@test typeof(N) <: DeterministicNetwork
