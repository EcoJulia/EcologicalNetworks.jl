    shuffle(N::BinaryNetwork; constraint::Symbol=:degree, number_of_swaps::Int64=1000, size_of_swap=(3,3), number_of_candidates::Int64=100)

Returns a new network with its interactions shuffled under a given constraint.
The possible constraints are:

- `:degree`, which keeps the degree distribution intact
- `:generality`, which keeps the out-degree distribution intact
- `:vulnerability`, which keeps the in-degree distribution intact
- `:fill`, which moves interactions around freely

Note that this function will conserve the degree (when appropriate under the
selected constraint) *of every species*.

This function takes sub-matrices of size `size_of_swap` (the value of
`size_of_swap` is anything which is accepted by thee `sample` function), and
shuffle them around `number_of_swaps` time. At every step, there are
`number_of_candidates` shuffled matrices generated, and the first that matches
the constraints is used.

The size and connectance of the network, as well as the performance of the
computer used, should be considered when modifying the values of these
parameters.
