    overlap(N::T; dims=dims::Union{Nothing,Integer}=nothing) where {T <: BipartiteNetwork}

Returns the overlap graph for a bipartite network. The `dims` keyword argument
can be `1` (default; overlap between top-level species) or `2` (overlap between
bottom-level species). See the documentation for `?overlap` for the output
format.

    overlap(N::T; dims::Union{Nothing,Integer}=nothing) where {T <: UnipartiteNetwork}

Returns the overlap graph for a unipartite network. The `dims` keyword argument
can be `1` (overlap based on preys) or `2` (overlap based on predators), or
`nothing` (default; overlap based on both predators and preys). The overlap is
returned as a vector of named tuples, with elements `pair` (a tuple of species
names), and `overlap` (the number of shared interactors). The ordering within
the pair of species is unimportant, since overlap graphs are symetrical.
